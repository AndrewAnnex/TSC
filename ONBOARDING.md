# Onboarding/Offboarding

Please refer to the
[Establishment of the TSC](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/TSC/blob/master/TSC-Charter.md#section-4-establishment-of-the-tsc)
in the TSC Charter. In the event that there is a contradiction between that
document and this document, the contradictory elements in this document are
invalid and are superseded by the TSC Charter.

## Onboarding

* Confirm that the new member has read, understands, and agrees to uphold the
  [Code of Conduct](https://usgs-astrogeology.github.io/code/).
* Add the new member to the `@USGS-Astrogeology/TSC` team.
* Change the new member's role in the GitHub `USGS-Astrogeology` organization to `Owner`.
* Update the repository Members to reflect membership in the TSC.

## Offboarding

* Remove the member to the `@USGS-Astrogeology/TSC` team.
* Change the member's role in the GitHub `USGS-Astrogeology` organization to `Member`
  unless they have `Owner` role for a reason other than TSC membership.
* Update the repository Members to reflect membership in the TSC.
  In all likelihood, they should be listed as TSC Emeritus.
