# Versioning

For all long lived ASC software projects we have adopted the semantic
versioning specification ([meeting notes](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/TSC/blob/master/meetings/2018-12-18.md#versioning)). See [https://semver.org](https://semver.org) for the specification for semantic versioning.
