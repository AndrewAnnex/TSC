# TSC Meeting April 9, 2019 @12PM MST

## [Hangouts Link](https://hangouts.google.com/hangouts/_/doi.gov/jlaura)

## Agenda
- Organizing a planetary science software group.
- New TSC membership - Andrew Annex, Victor Silva
- PlanetaryPy: Update on the conversation with Austin G., Andrew A., Chase M., T. Hare, and myself.
    As a non-TSC member, and discussed by the group listed in this agenda, I would like to see (taking guidance from the Astropy effort):
    1. PlanetaryPy become a community effort to develop a core package for planetary research using the Python programming language.
    1. Have this help to improve usability, interoperability, and collaboration between planetary-related Python packages.
    1.  Austin, the current owner of PlanetaryPy, has initially agree to allow the namespace be used for these purposes. https://github.com/planetarypy Initial repositories to be maintained would be PVL. Others I would like to see maintained but probably with a need for updating would be planetaryimage, planetary_test_data, and possibly pdsview (but looking at other available viewers also available like pds4_viewer).
    1. Have the TSC (or group defined to PlanetaryPy) help to define "core" needs -- or various classes, utilities, and a packaging framework intended to provide commonly-used planetary research tools. For example bringing in SpiceyPy, perhaps other exiting code like Small Body Node's Python_PDS4_Tools, etc. http://sbndev.astro.umd.edu/wiki/Python_PDS4_Tools
    1. Possibly look at the astropy method of including "affiliated packages." An affiliated package would be a planetary-related python package that is not part of the PlanetaryPy core source code, but has been requested to be included.
    1. To help move this forward as a sustained community project, look at housing converted or future mission pipelines (e.g. Mars2020, HiRISE) under PlanetaryPy.
